For running the code use /bin/python3 $PATH$ a_star_DarshitMiteshkumar_Shivam.py in the linux or VSCode Terminal

## Results

### Here's a screenshot of the explored node vectors (black) and the path taken (green line) with the obstacle map (red):

The parameters of the simulation for search are as below

Terminal inputs:
